To celebrate this idea, Paymentus welcomed someone who knows a thing or two about bills – Bill the Duck. For two decades, Bill has helped our clients keep their customer service afloat, get their ducks in a row and best serve those who have bills. Today, we’re excited to celebrate Bill and all those who have flown with us over these last 20 years. Here’s to greater successes to come!"
